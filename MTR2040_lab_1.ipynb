This is by design in **Jupyter**. You can print any result explicity using the \"print\" command. Notice how in the cell below, all three lines are printed when the print function is explicitly called. However, it is fine to not use the print command if you are only interested in the result of a single line of code (the last line) in Jupyter. If you want to print text, also known as a \"string\" in programming, wrap the text around quotation marks. You can use single or double quotation marks (as long as they are consistent), but convention is to generally use double quotations."
